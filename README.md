Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

Problem Statement:

This project aims to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. By analyzing customer-level data, we seek to identify patterns associated with fraudulent activities and develop a model to prevent financial losses.

Project Approach:

Data Exploration: Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand data characteristics and identify potential patterns.
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and imbalanced data.
Model Development: Developed and deployed a machine learning model to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with 95% accuracy.
Technology Stack: Utilized Python, Scikit-learn, and data preprocessing techniques to build a robust fraud detection system.
Model Improvement: Implemented model monitoring and retraining for continuous improvement.
